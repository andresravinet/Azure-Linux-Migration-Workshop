# Analyzing the value of a migration to Azure<br>Review dependency mappings & financial analyses

## Expected Outcome

This challenge will provide you hands-on access to the StratoZone assessment tool.  By creating a new assessment and navigating through the tool, you will see how it is able to generate a number of reports on your source environment as you consider a migration to Microsoft Azure.  As part of this challenge we will examine the process of creating an assessment, reviewing data and cloud-fit scores, performing machine shaping and generating a financial model. You will also see how StratoZone is able to integrate with migration tools such as CloudEndure and ASR.

## Process

![Create Assessment](./images/strat-create-new-assessment-1.jpg)

1. <strong>Create a new assessment</strong>
    * Follow the steps to create a new assessment
    ![Create Assessment](./images/strat-create-new-assessment-2.jpg) 

    * On the details tab, create a location for the assessment that represents a subset of your data center.
    ![Details](./images/strat-create-new-assessment-3.jpg) 

    * Do not change any of the details on Run Schedule or Data Security (can be changed by your administrators later) -- Just click "Save & Next"
    * The system will email the assessment package as shown on the Downloads tab.  Normally, you would deploy the agent(s) emailed to you onto the hosts in your data center, however for the purposes of this lab, the e-mail does not need to be used; We will use the sample data that already been pre-loaded into the StratoZone portal.

2. <strong>Review the data to be analyzed</strong>

    * After the assessment package has been generated, click "Done" then click on the "Summary" tab. Here can you see an overview of the data that has been collected by the agents which have been deployed.

    * Click on the "Assessments" tab. Multiple on-premise and cloud assessments can be done for all of your locations and will aggregate all of the data into StratoZone

    * Click on the "Inventory" tab. This tab will allow you to view the specific inventory sets that have been collected for all of the assessments which have been run.

    * In this example, we have expanded the inventory of the "Chicago" location which shows information on all of the host servers that have been registered.

    * For the purposes of this lab, the host we will focus on is named "dev-jira"; Click on it and review the data collected

    * Now click on the "Dependency" tab and drill-down to the same "div-jira" host; Click on it and review the dependency map.  This map is automatically generated by the agents deployed on each host and provides observed host-to-host communication in this model; StratoZone is also able to provide app-to-app level communcation as well. It is crucial to understand server relationships and dependency mappings when planning a migration to Microsoft Azure to ensure services are migrated as a group.

    * Click on the "StratoFit" tab and drill down in the available assessments to the "dev-jira" host to determine the StratoFit rating
    ![Stratofit Tab-Dev Jira](./images/strat-summary-7.jpg)

    * Since the StratoFit rating is either "Low" or "Medium", a report is automatically generated showing the items that StratoZone has detected which may require remediation prior to migration to Microsoft Azure.

3. <strong>Machine shaping and financial modeling</strong>

   * Click on the "Options" icon next to the "Settings" icon in the upper-right corner of the screen; Choose Plan
   * Click on the "StratoSpec" tab
   * Drill down to the "dev-jira" host once again to view the hardware profile for this host
   * On the left side of the page, click on "Customize Sizing Defaults" to view the shaping matrix. On this page you can determine what your target host platform in Microsoft Azure would look like based on the specifications you provide and how much additional overhead you would require per virtual machine for peak workloads. Examine the different options that are available to you and that your enterprise may require.
